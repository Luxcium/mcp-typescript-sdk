# Product Context

MCP allows applications to separate context provisioning from LLM interaction. This SDK enables Node.js developers to expose data, tools, and prompts via standardized transports (stdio, HTTP, WebSockets) and provides client utilities to consume those services. The aim is to streamline LLM integration workflows and foster interoperability between MCP-compatible tools.
