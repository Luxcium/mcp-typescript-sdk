# Project Brief

This repository contains the TypeScript SDK for the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The goal of the project is to provide a complete client and server implementation of the MCP specification so that developers can easily build MCP servers and clients in TypeScript/JavaScript environments. The SDK supports multiple transports and provides utilities for OAuth, tools, resources, and prompts.
